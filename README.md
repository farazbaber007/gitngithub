**Git Configuration
As you read briefly in Getting Started, you can specify Git configuration settings with the git config command. One of the first things you did was set up your name and email address:

$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
Now youâ€™ll learn a few of the more interesting options that you can set in this manner to customize your Git usage.
